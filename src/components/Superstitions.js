            Do not spend a penny that you find. Instead, save it for luck.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you place a penny in your shoe, it will bring good fortune.
          </li>
          <li>
            Carrying three pennies with you is going to bring you good luck.
          </li>
          <li>
            Throwing a penny coin over your left shoulder into a wishing well or
            water will grant your wish.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tossing a penny when you have a problem enables fate to take care of
            the issue for you.
          </li>
          <li>Coins with holes in them are considered especially lucky.</li>
          <li>
            If you put the first penny you get every day into your pocket, you
            are going to attract more as the day continues.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you find a penny, it means that there is more money coming your
            way.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you keep a coin in your babyâ€™s crib, the baby will grow up to be
            wise, wealthy, and healthy.
          </li>
          <li>
            To secure good luck, you should carry a penny that was minted in
            your birth year.
          </li>
          <li>
            Having a jar filled with pennies in your kitchen is good luck.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you toss a penny overboard while you are traveling at sea, it
            will bring you a safe trip.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some also say that you should carry a penny in your pocketbook,
            which is wrapped in paper, so you are able to say that you are never
            broke.
